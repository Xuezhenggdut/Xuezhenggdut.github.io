  - 每一个种类的工作的工作可能有好几个。不要像叠罗汉一样，可以按照他们的推进程度来进行排序。比如a做了什么，b在a的基础上提出了什么，c又在b的基础上改进了什么。但是，大多数情况，我们参考的论文并不会这么相关，也不会真的谁基于谁，那么这时候有一个提示：发表时间。比如a是2010年发的，那么它考虑的东西可能就没有b那么多，b就比它更近了一步。如果时间都一样，都是2015年，那么在方法上具体的去考量，比如a改进的是某个方面，这个方面比较容易想到的，而b改进的方面没那么容易想到，而且效果更好，结果表现也提高得更多，那么我们就把b放在a后面说。总之，就是要让各个例子之间，能够有个顺序，这个顺序最好是递进的，升华的，所以我们才会把我们的工作摆在最后，因为最后的都是最好的
