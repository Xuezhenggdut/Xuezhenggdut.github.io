I am currently pursing the Ph.D degree, advised by [Prof. Guojun Han](https://teacher.gdut.edu.cn/hanguojun) in information and communication engineering at Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China. Since September 2022, I have been visiting the State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy, and the School of
Vehicle and Mobility, at Tsinghua University. During my visit, I have been advised by [Assoc. Prof. Fuxi Wen](https://wenfuxi.github.io/). My research interests include vehicular networks, edge computing and cooperative perception.
